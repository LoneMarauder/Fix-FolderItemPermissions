# Fix-FolderItemPermissions.ps1

# This script fixes item-level security for specific items in desktop folders by restoring inherited permissions
# This seems to be needed when you move an item from the desktop into a folder synced with OneDrive, and overwrite an existing shortcut
# Why this has to be done is beyond me
# This script needs to be run as Administrator for proper filesystem rights.  If anyone knows how to do this in code, please let me know.

# VERSION HISTORY
# Version 1.0 - Initial release

# This script requires the "NTFSSecurity" module by Raimund Andr√©e; it can be installed with "install-module NTFSSecurity"
import-module NTFSSecurity

# Get the current user's desktop folder (in case it is redirected)
